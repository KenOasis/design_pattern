# Structural

## Adapter

#### Keys: interfaces connector

- Converts the interface you get to the interface you need

## Bridge

#### Keys: Decouple implementation

- Decouple abstraction from implementation

## Composite

#### Keys: Same interface for single object and collections

- Allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly

## Decorator

#### Keys: Addition responsibilities without modifying or inheritance

- Attach additional responsibilities to objects without modifying those objects or inheriting from them
- Decorators are composable with each other

## Facade (Fasade)

#### Keys: Same interface for the api (even changing the implementation/with complex subsystems)

- Provide a single unified interface over a set of systems/interfaces

## Flyweight

#### Keys: Memory saving

- Memory saving technique
- Efficiently support very large numbers of similar objects

## Proxy

#### Keys: surrogate object for additional functions

- Provide a surrogate object that forwards calls to the real object while performing additional functions
- E.g., access control, communication, logging....
