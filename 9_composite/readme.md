## Motivation

- Objects use ohter objects' fields/methods through inheritance and composition
- Composition lets us make compound objects
  -E.g., a mathematical expression composed of simple expressions; or
  - A shape group mad of several different shapes
- Composite design pattern is used to treat both single (scalar) and composite objects uniformly
  - I.e., class Foo and an array (containing Foo) having the same API

## Formal Definition

- A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner (same interface)

## Summary

- Objects can use other objects via inheritance/composition
- Some composed and singular objects need similar/identical behaviors(api)
- Composite design pattern lets us treat both types of objects uniformly
- JavaScript supports iteration with Symbol.iterator (!!!)
- A single object can make itself iterable yielding this (!!!)
