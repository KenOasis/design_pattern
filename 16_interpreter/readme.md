## Motivation

Textual input needs to be processed

- E.g., turned into OOP structure

Some examples

- Programming language compilers, interpreters and IDEs
- HTML, XML and similar
- Numeric expressions (3 + 4/5)
- Regular expressions

Turning strings into OOP based structures in a complicated process

## Formal definition

A component that processes structured text data. Doe so by turning it into separate lexical tokens(lexing) and then interpreting sequences of said tokens

## Summary

Barring simple cases, an interpreter acts in two stage:

- Lexing turns text into a set of separate tokens
- Parsing tokens into meaningful (Object oriented)constructs
